# K-Nearest-Neighbors-Classifier (KNN):

The Wine Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository consists of the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown within the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivers. The analysis determined 13 constituents (attributes) found in the three types of wine. The K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that will be used to classify and test the perfomance of this model. 80% of the data will be reserved for training and the remaining 20% will be used for testing. Features were standardized/scaled in order to prevent the dominance of one feature over another as well as providing all features with a consistent scale. This model evalution differs from a normal binary classification becasue instead of two classes we are now working with three. This required some adjustments to the Confusion Matrix calculation. Random state was also taken into consideration. Overall model accuracy with a random state of 42 was 94.4% but as noted on code when a random state of 73 was used model accuaracy improved to 100%.
